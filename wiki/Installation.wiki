= Introduction =

There are a few methods of installing python-money.  You can either download/checkout the project and use *setup.py*.  Or if you've installed [http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/index.html pip] you can grab it from [http://pypi.python.org/pypi PyPi] or straight out of the project repository.

* There are currently no published artifacts either here or on PyPi.  The project is available though SVN only for the moment, but I will try and publish something as soon as possible *

== Using setup.py ==

First, either download the latest tarball from the [http://code.google.com/p/python-money/downloads/list download page].

Extract the source with
{{{
tar -xzf python-money-XXX.tar.xzf
}}}

*OR*

Checkout the latest version from the project repository using SVN.
{{{
svn checkout http://python-money.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ python-money-read-only
}}}

Then cd into the project directory
{{{
cd python-money
}}}

and just run setup.py
{{{
python setup.py install
}}}

== Using pip ==

If you have pip installed your can install from the PyPi repository

{{{
pip install python-money
}}}

or if you want the latest version, you can install directly from the project repository

{{{
pip install svn+http://python-money.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
}}}

== Testing your installation ==

Open up a python shell and see you can import python-money classes

{{{
~$ python
>>> from money import Money
>>> Money(6, 'AUD')
AUD 6.0
}}}
